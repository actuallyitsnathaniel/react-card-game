// UPGRADES TO DO
// ****************
// 1. Store a history of user's lowest number of moves
// and notify them if they've set a new high score
// 2. Randomize the way cards are animated to their final position
// 3. Automatically flip cards back if more than 2 are visible
// and it's been 2+ seconds since last user action


1. HIGH SCORE (Async Saving?)
- Utilize moveCount within the state to compare high scores
- Save previous moveCount as prevMoveCount
- Save Asyncronously to be accessed later
- When game is finished, show score LIST 
    - Probably remove alert and have a new screen!
